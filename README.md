### Algorithms for big data

**Hanoi tower**: function dealing with hanoi tower problem with 4 or more disks (recurssion)

**Deterministic-Selection**: based on Median of Medians algorithm ( each recursive call would only be on a subset of half the values) 

**Randomized-Selection**: also dealing with quicksort problem, only instead of picking pivot *p* as median, randomly select pivot *p* from the array

**Unfair dice**: Using 3-sided unfair dice generates U.I.I.D sample

**Gibbs MC**

**Image-Reconstruction**: Using low-rank approximation based on divied matrix to reconstruct the image at best possible quality with the least sigular values

**Power-method**: Fast SVD for large matrix multiplications 

**Matrix-sketch**: Approximate solution to a variation of the frequent problem (data-streaming)
